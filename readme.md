# My Youtube Player

## The Problem:

I use [Cold Turkey](https://getcoldturkey.com/) to prevent myself from spending much time watching youtube videos. Cold Turkey blocks all youtube videos not only the inessential ones.  
The problem comes when I want to watch an important youtube video or watch a course playlist.

## The Solution:

I'm building this youtube player to give me the ability to watch content that I have its id. I can get the id from google searches or educational articles. and I'm building the download feature using an external API to download videos and playlists.
