# TubeLinker

## Introduction

TubeLinker is a web application and a browser extension that allows you to watch and download youtube videos and playlists easily. This application is designed to help users who face the problem of excessive youtube usage and are looking for a solution to watch important videos or playlists without wasting time on unnecessary content.

## The Problem

Many users face the problem of excessive youtube usage, and to overcome it, they use tools such as Cold Turkey to block youtube videos. However, Cold Turkey blocks all youtube videos, including the important ones that users want to watch, such as educational videos or playlists.

## The Solution

To solve this problem, I have developed TubeLinker, which allows users to watch youtube videos and playlists by entering their video ID. Users can easily find the ID of the video or playlist they want to watch by searching on Google or reading educational articles.

The application also provides a download feature that allows users to download youtube videos and playlists using an external API.

## Features

- Watch youtube videos and playlists by entering their ID.
- Download youtube videos and playlists.
- Available as a web application and a browser extension.
